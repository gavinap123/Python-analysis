What is important is that the first generation of gamers is now grown up with significant spending power; therefore, despite high penetration rates among kids, video games can no longer be considered solely a child's play. In fact, it was found that video gaming is gaining on popularity among the seniors in the United States.<br>\n","<br>\n","This data provides video sales information together with game scores and ratings.
